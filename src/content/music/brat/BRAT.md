I think this might be my favorite album of 2024.

It might have changed my life a little bit, and I know it sounds really corny, but listening to this album made me appreciate my more artistic and expressive side a lot more. I just wanted to feel like the album: careless, explosive, and free from all of these fears and this anxiety I feel all the time socially. It made me realize that I could do what I wanted and no one could tell me anything.

The vibes of the album are immaculate. No other album has had a cultural impact so much as this one in the last couple of years, and I think it's because a lot of people feel like I feel, and this album helps them channel those feelings too. Brat summer is gonna live on in my mind forever, and I'm always gonna be grateful for this album.

All the songs sound amazing; they all have this retro throwback feeling while at the same time sounding really fresh. What I like the most is this personal touch that Charli puts into each and every song, it makes it feel less like a mainstream pop album and more like something you can actually relate to. The homage to SOPHIE is beautiful and makes me emotional every time I listen to it.

I know that in a couple of years I'll be looking back at this album with really nice feelings and memories attached to it. It sparked this will to change the way I am, to be the best version of myself, and I will forever be thankful for it.
