Possibly my favourite album of all time, I have a really personal connection to this album.

To me it always sounded like magic since the first time i listened to it. I still remember the first time i listened to it. It was like 2019 and i was just starting to listen to albums and pay more attention to music as an artform. I think that there is not a better album to get more involved with music than this one.

All the songs are amazing and they have this ongoing story, you can hear how everything evolves and it's like you're listening to a story in a different way and it's beautiful.
