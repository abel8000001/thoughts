I'm not really sure why, but this album just feels right to me. I really love it. It just sounds so quirky; it's synthpop done in this really lo-fi way with the old console noises and raw waves and clicks and I love the way everything flows together with Alice's voice. Some parts of the album are really funny, and some others just sound so beautiful to me. I really like this whole aesthetic they had on this album, and it's something I miss when I listen to later records made by them. This one just sounds happier, I don't know how to explain it.

I've always been in love with late 00's - early 10's scene and I feel this album is like a window to that era, its sound and vibe falls really close to home because I think this is a very "internet" sound, like this is what being chronically online sounded like at that time. I can only imagine scrolling through Myspace and Tumblr or something while listening to this, it just feels right.

I really need to get deeper into synthpop, I feel like I'm missing on so much great music like this, I don't even know why I don't listen to this genre that much knowing how much I love it. Maybe someday.
