This album is weird because listening to it doesn't make me feel particularly happy, so to me it's really hard to listen to. It really helps me be more comfortable when I'm feeling bad, but it doesn't make me feel better or anything like that.

Its sound just sort of calms me down, I can get lost forever in these layered walls of synths and guitars. The hooks can get stuck in my head for days. I love how this album makes me feel because I think I sometimes need to feel like this; sometimes not feeling well is ok, and this record really helps me channel all these feelings I can have.

I always end up feeling really calm, it sometimes helps me to sleep and it's not because it's boring, but more because it just puts me in that mood. I definetly need to listen to more of their albums in the future, but for now I think this is all I need from them. The album is beautiful and I don't wanna listen to it too often because I don't want it to lose that magic that to me it currently has.
