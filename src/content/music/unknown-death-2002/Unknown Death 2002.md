This one brings back memories. I remember I listened to this album a lot in 10th grade on my way to school. It was like 5:50 A.M and the weather was almost always cold, and this album fitted perfectly with everything.

It’ll always be crazy to me the fact that this album is more than 10 years old. It sounds really amateur but all the ideas they had were so fresh that it made everything sound like its own thing, its own little bubble of sound. I don’t know if I would listen to a remastered version if they ever released one, I like the sound of this album so much because the mixing makes it feel really intimate, like you’re hearing some songs your friend made and shared to you.

I will always have this album close to my heart because Lean and his friends were just doing their own thing at the time and having fun expressing themselves in a really personal way, and I resonate with that a lot.
