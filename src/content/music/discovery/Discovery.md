* Face to Face
* Too Long

Daft Punk is just so good. I don't even know what to say about them. They're just so good.

Discovery is, to me, the perfect Electronic Dance album. It has giant hits like One More Time and Harder Better Harder Stronger, beautiful tracks like Nightvision or Veridis Quo, and snappy party tracks like High Life or Too Long.

It's perfect; it's so full of great, timeless music, you just wanna dance all night long to every song. I get so happy and energetic every time I listen to it because it's just that good. I've listened to Daft Punk since I was a kid and they've always been there with me. It doesn't matter how much my music taste evolves and changes; I'll listen to any of their albums at least once every 2 weeks, and Discovery is the one I've been listening to the most lately. It just scratches that timeless EDM itch I have every once in a while, and to me it will never stop sounding fresh even after all these years. The fact that I like it so much and it's not even their best album is so crazy to me.

I'm gonna miss them a lot; it's really sad I'm probably never going to experience a new release by them. The good thing is that they left this beautiful catalogue of music and a legacy that's gonna last forever, and I'm happy with that.
