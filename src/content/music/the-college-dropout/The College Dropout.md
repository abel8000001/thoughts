Kanye's debut story is one of the most beautiful and inspiring success stories I've ever heard, and this album is the culmination of that fight he pulled to be considered more than just a producer.

I listened to this record for the first time after watching the documentary he released a couple of years ago about this era in his life. I still remember how inspiring it was to see him fight so hard for what he loves, and I remember it every time I listen to this album. You can feel the passion emanating from every song, you can tell how hard he worked on everything related to this album. That's what I like the most about listening to it, the passion that went into it.

It's amazing how many great songs are in this album, and it's even more amazing how many great bars are in each song. I don't know how he did it but the amount of insane bars in the album is just unbelievable, I still laugh at some of them even though I don't even know how many times I've listened to them, this album is just that good.

To me this record is really special because just thinking about the story behind it fills me with determination; if Kanye was able to do it, then I can achieve my dreams too. That's what I love the most about it, its existence reminds me that I can also make it in life if I fight for it hard enough.
