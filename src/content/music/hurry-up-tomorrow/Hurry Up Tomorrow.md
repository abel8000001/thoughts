I love this album.

It's long and epic; you can really feel the desperation in some of the tracks, but my favorite thing about it is how it sounds. The production, mixing, and mastering of every song feels absolutely amazing. I don't know how they did it but it has some of the most insane synth arrangements I've ever heard on an album. The moment I learned Mike Dean would be on the album I knew it was gonna sound amazing, but it still surprised me. I love how every single sound feels and flows with Abel's (the fact that we share names is always gonna be funny to me) voice.

It's one of my favorite albums of the year and it just started. I'm really excited to see what he does in the future.
