It's been a while since I listened to an album like this. It feels so snappy, so tight, the first tracks sound dirty but there's some sort of melodic evolution on the second half, her flow is perfect, etc, etc. It was really hard to pick just 5 songs to highlight, it's really balanced in terms of quality.

I needed this album; you can tell it was made with love and passion, it's fun to listen to, length is perfect, there's really not much else to say. It's just a great rap album with great beats, great flow, great hooks, great everything.

I listened to it after it won best rap album at the grammys, I remember hearing about it when it came out but never got myself to actually listening to it. I'm so happy I did though, I love it.
