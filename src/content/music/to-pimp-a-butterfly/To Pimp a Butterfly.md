<br>

The best rap album ever made by the greatest rapper of all time.

I can't even begin to explain how this album makes me feel. The passion this man has for his culture, his community and the art he makes makes me appreciate everything about this project.
You can really tell that the songs have a soul, every single song is so full of substance and passion and you can really hear it without even listening to the lyrics or understanding what they say.

The narrative on the album is also insane, the fragments of the poem being slowly dropped just to conclude with this crazy segment at the end of the album, I think it wraps it up perfectly. What Kendrick did with this album can't be understated, I love it with all my heart
