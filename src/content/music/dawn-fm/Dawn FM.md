I still remember the night this album came out. I had school the next day but I didn't care and stayed awake for the release. I regret nothing! I love this album so much; its sound clicks with me in a way few other albums do.

It has this deep electronic sound with the heavy synths and the catchy hooks flowing in this beautiful concept of life and death, some songs are absolute bangers, the length of the record is perfect, and I love it all throughout.

I don't really know what else to write about it; it's just a great album that came out at the perfect time for me because I was just exploring my musical taste and it helped me realize how much I love this sound. Every time I listen to it it reminds me of a different time in my life, and it makes me quite happy.

I'm really glad that The Weeknd went in this musical path, because this trilogy of projects might be my favorite thing out of pop music.
